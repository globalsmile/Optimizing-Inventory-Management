# Introduction

The goal of this sales management analysis is to create an executive sales report for sales managers.

Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been over time

# Problem Statement

Based on the request that was made from the business we are following the user stories that were defined to fulfill delivery and ensure that acceptance criteriaâ€™s were maintained throughout the project.

| #	As a (role) | I want (request / demand) | So that I (user value) | Acceptance Criteria |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1	Sales Manager | To get a dashboard overview of internet sales | Can follow better which customers and products sells the best | A Power BI dashboard which updates data once a day |
| 2	Sales Representative | A detailed overview of Internet Sales per Customers | Can follow up my customers that buys the most and who we can sell more to | A Power BI dashboard which allows me to filter data for each customer |
| 3	Sales Representative | A detailed overview of Internet Sales per Products | Can follow up my Products that sells the most | A Power BI dashboard which allows me to filter data for each Product |

# Data Sourcing

- The Dataset used for this analysis was sourced from [AdventureWorks sample databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms) 
- Additional dataset is available at: [Sales Budget](https://github.com/globalsmile/Sales-Management-Analysis/blob/main/SalesBudget.xlsx)
- The query used to update the database can be found

# Data Preparation

Data transformation was done in Power Query and the dataset was loaded into Microsoft Excel Power Pivot for modeling.

The client's financial data consists of  2 worksheets containing 2 tables:

- `Transactions` which has `4 columns and 296 rows` of observation
- `Budget` which has `15 columns and 24 rows` of observation

The tabulation below shows the `Transactions` table with its column names and their description:
| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Date | Represents the date of the transaction |
| Description | Describes the transaction narration |
| Category | Describes the category of the transaction |
| Amount | Represents the amount  of the transaction |

The tabulation below shows the `Budget` table with its column names and their description:
| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Category | Describes the category of the budget |
| Class | Describes the class of the budget |
| Type | Describes the the type of the budget |
| Jan 2021 - Dec 2021 | Represents the budget amount for each month respectively |


Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in power query as follows:

- For the `Budget` table, the columns from `Jan 2021` to `Dec 2021` where unpivoted
- The resulting `Attribute` and `Value` columns where renamed to `Date` and `Amount` respectively 
- Validated the accuracy of the of `Date` column by changing the type to `date only`
- Validated the accuracy of the of `Amount` column by changing the type to `whole number`
- A dimension table named `categories` was created by referencing the `Budget` table
- Unneccessary columns were removed from the `categories` table
- Duplicate rows were removed from `categories` table

To ensure the accuracy of the dates in the `Date` column each of the tables, a date table was created for referencing using the M-formula:

`{Number.From(List.Min(Transactions[Date]))..Number.From(List.Max(Transactions[Date]))}`

Here is a breakdown of what the formula does:

For the dataset, we want the start date to reflect the earliest to latest date that we have in the data: January 01, 2021 - December 01, 2021.

`Month`,` Month Name`, `Year` columns were extracted from the date table

The date table was named `Calender`.

# Data Modeling

After the dataset was cleaned and transformed, it was ready to be modeled(using Power Pivot).

- The `Calender` table was marked as the official date table in the dataset.
- A `one-to-many (*:1) relationship` was created between the `Budget` and the `Calender` tables using the `date` column in each of the tables
- A `one-to-many (*:1) relationship` was created between the `Transactions` and the `Calender` tables using the `date` column in each of the tables 
- A `one-to-many (*:1) relationship` was created between the `Transactions` and the `Categories` tables using the `Category` column in each of the tables
- A `one-to-many (*:1) relationship` was created between the `budget` and the `Categories` tables using the `Category` column in each of the tables 
- The realtioships formed in the data model is a `Star Schema` and is shown below:

# Data Visualization

Data visualization for the dataset was done using Microsft Excel:

- The `Dashboard` worksheet: Shows the Actual amount, Budget amount, Balance, etc of the client.

Figure 1 shows visualizations from `Dashboard` worksheet

# Data Analysis

Measures used in visualization are:

- Actual = `SUM(Transactions[Amount])`
- Balance = `SUM(Budget[Amount])`
- Balance = `[Budget]-[Actual]`


As shown from [Data Visualization](https://github.com/globalsmile/Client-Finacial-Analysis#Data-Visualization), It can be deducted that for the year ending December 2021:

- The client budgeted a total amount of `$230,502`
- The client spent a total amount of `$193,228`
- The client has a balance of `$37,274`

---

# Insights

As shown by [Data Visualization](https://github.com/globalsmile/Client-Finacial-Analysis#Data-Visualization), It can be deducted that:

- The client spent the most in the month of `January`
- The client spent the least in the month of `November`
- The client has spent the highest amount on `Social`


Key Note: The client has a monthly budget amount of more than `$16k`,also the client has been able to stay afloat of this budget amount and as such stable enough to warrant a monetary investment
